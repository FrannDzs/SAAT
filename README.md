# San Andreas Audio Toolkit (SAAT) - Version 1.10

SAAT is a collection of command-line tools designed for modding the PC version of the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It enables the import of music files into SA audio streams and the import of wave files into SA SFX archives. Additionally, it facilitates exporting from these archives into individual files. SAAT, written by Dave Schmitt (aka "p.D. Escobar") in C++, is an open-source program released under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL). It builds upon the foundation of the open-source program [Radio Free San Andreas](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~creideiki/radio-free-san-andreas/) and incorporates various open-source libraries such as [libogg](http://www.xiph.org/downloads/) and [libvorbis](http://www.xiph.org/downloads/) for Ogg Vorbis processing, as well as [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) for other sound processing.

## Documentation

Here's a concise overview of SAAT. For more comprehensive documentation and usage examples, refer to [manual.txt](./manual.txt). To explore the changes in this version, see [changes.txt](./changes.txt).

## Installation (Windows Binaries)

1. Unzip the two executables and all INI files into a convenient location, such as the GTASA main directory.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the installation directory.

## Usage (Stream Tool)

- `saat_stream.exe -e`: Simple export mode; exports all tracks from <input_file>, storing the Ogg Vorbis files in appropriately named subdirectories of <output_directory>.
- `saat_stream.exe -r`: Rfsa export mode; similar to -e, but uses additional descriptive information from <reference_file> to tag and name exported files.
- `saat_stream.exe -i`: Import mode; creates <output_file> based on information and filename references in <input_file>. Also updates references to reflect changes.

## Usage (SFX Tool)

- `saat_sfx.exe -e`: Export mode; exports all sounds from <input_file>, storing the wave files in appropriately named subdirectories of <output_directory>. Uses <reference_file> to locate sounds.
- `saat_sfx.exe -i`: Import mode; creates <output_file> based on information and filename references in <input_file>. Updates references accordingly.

## Acknowledgements

The following individuals and projects have contributed significantly to SAAT:

- SAAT is built upon [Radio Free San Andreas (RFSA)](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~creideiki/radio-free-san-andreas/), released under the GNU GPL. RFSA's primary author is Karl-Johan Karlsson. Adaptations by Marcus Eriksson made RFSA code compatible with SAAT.
- [Ondra Hosek](http://ondrasplayground.on.funpic.de/) contributed changes to RFSA that were integrated into the 32-bit Windows release of SAAT.
- SAAT employs Ogg Vorbis commenting routines derived from the [vorbis-tools distribution](http://www.xiph.org/downloads/), authored by Michael Smith and Ralph Giles.
- SAAT leverages example code from the [libsndfile distribution](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), developed by Eric de Castro Lopo.
- Stream decoding and encoding are built upon the work of Simon El√©n, who initially cracked Rockstar's stream encoding.
- SAAT incorporates and enhances stream metadata from [San Andreas Radio](http://www.tinyted.net/eddie/sanandreasradio/) by Eddie Edwards.
- SFX processing in SAAT benefited from the SFX bank header format posted on [GTA Forums](http://www.gtaforums.com/) by [Steve M](http://www.steve-m.com/).
